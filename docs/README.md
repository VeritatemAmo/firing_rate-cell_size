** Dendrite Type assigned, according to the Allen documentation (tag__dendrite_type from ../data/cell_types_specimen_details.csv): 
*** aspiny and sparsely spiny: roughly equate to interneurons. 
*** aspiny dendrites were defined by the absence of spiny protrusions, lack of a pronounced apical dendrite and/or axon that emerged from the soma or dendrite at odd angles, and had extensive local branching.
*** sparsely spiny dendrites were defined by the presence of infrequent to moderately frequent spiny protrusions (approximately one spine per 10 microns), lack of a pronounced apical dendrite and/or an axon that emerged from the soma or dendrite at odd angles, and had extensive local branching, and/or projected up to layer 1. Sparsely spiny neurons were only identified when a 63X image was present.
*** spiny: roughly equate to pyramidal or spiny stellate neurons
*** spiny dendrites were defined by the presence of frequent spiny protrusions (approximately one spine per 1-2 microns), an axon that descended perpendicularly down to the white matter with sparse, proximal branching occurring at right angles to the primary axonal branch and/or a pronounced primary, apical dendrite.
*** determined under 20X or 63X image of slices based on Braitenberg and Schuz, 1998
*** individual spines were not reconstructed or quantified in these neurons

** Apical Intactness, according to the Allen documentation (tag__apical from ../data/cell_types_specimen_details.csv):
*** Apical dendrite: A prominent, spiny dendrite that is clearly longer and frequently thicker at its base than all other dendrites. Apical dendrites typically extend toward the pial surface and may or may not end in a tuft.
*** Intact apical dendrite: An apical dendrite was deemed to be “intact” if the entire length of the primary dendritic branch was contained within the thickness of the slice, and was not cut off at either slice surface.
*** Truncated apical dendrite: An apical dendrite was deemed to be “truncated” if the primary dendritic branch was cut off at either slice surface.
