### Soma-related 
* ./jupyter_notebooks/neuron_soma_volume.ipynb
	* using swc files, getting individual cells' radius, surface area, and volume of soma, assuming the soma is a sphere. Modified from neuron_volume.ipynb. For future re-use, watch out the deprecated functions regarding getting morphology from swc files with neuro_morphology package and generating dataframe with append function in for loop. 
	* generate ./results/soma_volume_et_surface_et_radius.tsv (Oct 16, 2022)
